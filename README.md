These are essential Linux commands for managing and checking disk space on servers. They help you monitor usage, locate large files, clean unnecessary data, and assess disk health. Tools like df, du, and lsblk give quick overviews of space and partition info. You can also use find, ncdu, or journalctl to dig deeper and clean up. These commands are helpful in both troubleshooting and routine maintenance. They're lightweight, require minimal setup, and work on most distros. Regular use can help avoid full disks and performance issues.
